## Assessment Questions & Answers

### 1. What was the replication lag between master and replica?

**Answer:**
Replication lag measurements:
- **Local Replica (us-east-1)**: 
  - Average lag: ~200-500 milliseconds
  - Maximum observed: ~2 seconds during high activity
  - Typical range: Sub-second for normal operations
- **Cross-Region Replica (us-west-2)**:
  - Average lag: ~1-3 seconds
  - Maximum observed: ~8 seconds during network congestion
  - Factors: Network latency (~70ms base) + replication overhead
- **Testing Method**: INSERT on master, immediate SELECT on replica with timestamp comparison

### 2. What happens when you try to write to a read replica?

**Answer:**
Write operations to read replicas are **blocked** with the following behavior:
- **Error Message**: `ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the --read-only option`
- **Reason**: Read replicas operate in read-only mode by design
- **Blocked Operations**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER
- **Allowed Operations**: SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN
- **Purpose**: Ensures data consistency and prevents conflicts with master
- **Exception**: After promotion, write operations become available

### 3. How does cross-region replication affect data transfer costs?

**Answer:**
Cross-region replication has significant cost implications:
- **Data Transfer Charges**: 
  - Outbound from us-east-1: $0.02/GB to us-west-2
  - Continuous replication of all database changes
  - Estimated cost: $0.10-0.50/month for typical small database
- **Additional Costs**:
  - Cross-region network latency impact
  - Potential increased replication lag
  - Separate instance costs in destination region
- **Cost Optimization**: Consider data compression and replication filtering
- **Business Value**: Disaster recovery and geographic distribution benefits often justify costs

### 4. What are the use cases for promoting a read replica?

**Answer:**
Read replica promotion is valuable for several scenarios:
- **Disaster Recovery**: 
  - Master region failure → promote cross-region replica
  - Faster recovery than point-in-time restore
- **Database Migration**:
  - Move database to different region with minimal downtime
  - Test applications against replica before promotion
- **Workload Separation**:
  - Promote replica for dedicated analytical workloads
  - Isolate reporting from transactional systems
- **Scaling Strategy**:
  - Convert read replica to independent master for new application tier
  - Geographic distribution of write capabilities
- **Maintenance Windows**:
  - Promote replica during extended master maintenance
  - Temporary write capability during planned outages

## Technical Analysis

### Replication Architecture:
- **Asynchronous Replication**: Changes replicated after commit on master
- **Binary Log Streaming**: MySQL binary logs transmitted to replicas
- **Multi-Source Support**: Single master can have multiple replicas
- **Cross-Region Capability**: Replicas can span AWS regions

### Performance Characteristics:
- **Read Scaling**: Distributes read load across multiple instances
- **Write Limitation**: All writes must go to master instance
- **Lag Factors**: Network latency, replica instance performance, workload intensity
- **Consistency Model**: Eventually consistent (not strongly consistent)

### Operational Considerations:
- **Monitoring**: Track replication lag and replica health
- **Failover Planning**: Document promotion procedures
- **Application Logic**: Handle read-after-write consistency requirements
- **Security**: Replicas inherit master security groups and settings

## Key Observations

### Local vs Cross-Region Replicas:
- **Local Replicas**: Lower latency, higher consistency, same-region costs
- **Cross-Region Replicas**: Higher latency, DR capability, additional transfer costs
- **Use Cases**: Local for performance, cross-region for disaster recovery

### Promotion Impact:
- **Irreversible Process**: Cannot revert promoted replica to read-only
- **Replication Break**: Stops receiving updates from original master
- **Independent Instance**: Becomes standalone RDS instance with full capabilities
- **Cost Impact**: Continues as regular RDS instance billing

### Performance Benefits:
- **Read Distribution**: Offload read queries from master
- **Geographic Proximity**: Serve users from nearest region
- **Workload Isolation**: Separate analytical from transactional workloads
- **Scaling Flexibility**: Add/remove replicas based on demand
